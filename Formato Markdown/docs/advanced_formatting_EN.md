## 📋 **Tables**

You can create tables using vertical bars (`|`) and dashes (`-`) to separate columns and rows. Tables are ideal for organizing data in a clear and structured manner.

```markdown
| Header 1    | Header 2    | Header 3    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Data 1      | Data 2      | Data 3      |
| Data A      | Data B      | Data C      |
```

### Rendered Example:

| Header 1    | Header 2    | Header 3    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Data 1      | Data 2      | Data 3      |
| Data A      | Data B      | Data C      |

> **Tip:** Ensure the number of columns is consistent across all rows to avoid rendering errors.

## 📝 **Quotes**

To add quotes, use the `>` symbol at the beginning of a line. Quotes are useful for highlighting important phrases or references.

```markdown
> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci
```

### Rendered Example:

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci

Quotes can also be nested by using multiple `>` symbols.

```markdown
> Level 1
>> Level 2
```

### Rendered Example:

> Level 1  
>> Level 2

## 🛠️ **Code Blocks**

Code blocks are created with triple backticks (\`\`\`) at the start and end of the block. They are ideal for displaying code snippets in various programming languages.

```markdown
```python
# This is a Python code block
print("Hello, world!")
```
```

### Rendered Example:

```python
# This is a Python code block
print("Hello, world!")
```

You can specify different programming languages to apply syntax highlighting correctly. Examples include `javascript`, `html`, and `bash`.

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

### Rendered Example:

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

---

## 📂 **Text and Code Highlighting**

To highlight text or inline code, use a single backtick (`).

```markdown
The command `docker run` starts a container.
```

### Rendered Example:

The command `docker run` starts a container.

## 🔗 **References and Footnotes**

Markdown also supports references and footnotes in some advanced implementations. These features are useful for adding links and additional explanations without disrupting the text flow.

### **Link References**
Define links at the end of the document to improve readability.

```markdown
This is a [reference link][1].

[1]: https://www.example.com
```

### Rendered Example:

This is a [reference link][1].

[1]: https://www.example.com

### **Footnotes**

```markdown
This text has a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote explanation.
```

### Rendered Example:

This text has a footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the footnote explanation.

> **Note:** Footnotes may not be supported on all Markdown platforms. Ensure compatibility before using them.
